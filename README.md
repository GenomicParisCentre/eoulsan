Eoulsan
=======

Eoulsan is a versatile framework based on the Hadoop implementation of the MapReduce algorithm, dedicated to high throughput sequencing data analysis on distributed computers. With Eoulsan, users can easily set up a cloud computing cluster and automate the analysis of several samples at once using various software solutions available. Working either on standalone workstations or cloud computing clusters, Eoulsan provides an integrated and flexible solution for RNA-Seq data analysis of differential expression.

Eoulsan is available on the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Genomic platform website](http://transcriptome.ens.fr/eoulsan).

Developers can visit the [Developer Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/eoulsan/wiki/MainPage) to get more information how to contribute to the Eoulsan project and develop plug-ins.
