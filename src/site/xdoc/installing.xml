    <section name="Standard Installation">
     
      <p>The installation of Eoulsan on all *nix systems is quite similar and very easy. You don't need to be the root user of your system to install Eoulsan.</p> 
     
      <p>The only tool you need to have is a tar/gz/bz2/zip extractor.</p>
     
      <ul>
        <li><a href="download.html">Download Eoulsan</a> on our website.</li>

<source>
$ wget http://transcriptome.ens.fr/eoulsan/eoulsan-@@@VERSION@@@.tar.gz
</source>

        <li>Unzip the archive where you want install the software.</li>

<source>
$ tar xzf eoulsan-@@@VERSION@@@.tar.gz
</source>

        <li>Eoulsan is ready to run.</li>

<source>
$ cd eoulsan-@@@VERSION@@@
$ ./eoulsan.sh
</source>

      </ul>

      <p>If you want to run Eoulsan on a local Hadoop cluster, see the <a href="hadoopmode.html">Hadoop configuration page</a> for more informations about Hadoop installation and configuration.</p>
     

   </section>
   
   <a name="docker" />
   <section name="Installation using Docker">
   
     <p>It is very easy to install Eoulsan using Docker. You just had to execute the following command:</p>
<source>
$ curl @@@WEBSITE@@@/eoulsan-docker-installer.sh | bash
</source>
     <p>This command will create a <tt>eoulsan-docker.sh</tt> script in your current directory that launch Eoulsan in a Docker container with the right Environment. This script automatically:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Set Eoulsan environment variable of the host in the container</li>
       <li>Allow access to your <tt>~/.eoulsan</tt> configuration file by the container</li>
       <li>Mount Eoulsan resource repositories defined in <tt>~/.eoulsan</tt> configuration file in in the container</li>
     </ul> 
     
     <p>You can use <tt>eoulsan-docker</tt> just as the standard <tt>eoulsan.sh</tt> script.</p>
     
     <p>If you want to use another version of Eoulsan than the version defined in <tt>eoulsan-docker</tt>, 
     just edit the script and change the following line. For the latest version, you can of course reinstall the script.</p>
<source>
EOULSAN_VERSION=@@@VERSION@@@
</source>

     <p>The list of available docker versions of Eoulsan can be found on <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/genomicpariscentre/eoulsan/">docker website</a>.</p>
