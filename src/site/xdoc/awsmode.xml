    <p><b>Warning:</b> Eoulsan 2.x do not currently work on AWS. <b>This page is outdated</b>.</p>
  
    <section name="Configure Amazon Elastic MapReduce">

	<p>Currently Eoulsan can only work on cloud with Amazon Web Service. Eoulsan use 
           Amazon Elastic MapReduce service to execute an analysis on Cloud. This service 
           provide on demand Hadoop clusters to customers. You can get more information 
           about this service on <a href="ttp://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon 
           MapReduce website</a>.</p>

	<p>Once you get an Amazon Web Service Account and sign-in for Amazon 
           MapReduce and Amazon S3, go to Security credentials page of your AWS 
           Account. In this page create or get your access key. You need a couple 
           of valid access key/secret key to launch Eoulsan on Amazon Cloud.
           See the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/awsdocs/ElasticMapReduce/latest/emr-gsg.pdf">Amazon
           Elastic MapReduce Getting Started Guide</a> for more information. 
           Eoulsan use the AWS Java SDK library to transfer data to Amazon S3 and 
           launch Amazon Elastic MapReduce jobs.</p>


    <p>Eoulsan has been successfully tested with m1.xlarge instances and Hadoop 0.20, 0.20.205 and 1.03.</p>

    <section name="Configure Eoulsan to work with Amazon Elastic MapReduce">

	<p>Eoulsan behaviour with Amazon Elastic MapReduce is the same as with 
           a Hadoop cluster. You don't have to change your design file or the 
           steps of the workflow file.</p>
        <p>The only requierement is to set the AWS 
           credentials in configuration file or workflow file. We strongly 
           recommand to store this values in a configuration file. See the 
           <a href="conffile.html">configuration file</a> section for more 
           information.</p>

    </section>

  
    <section name="Launch Eoulsan in AWS mode">

	<p>The launch of an Eoulsan analysis on AWS is described in 
           <a href="./cmd-emrexec.html">AWS Elastic MapReduce exec command section</a>.</p>
