    <section name="Configure Amazon Elastic MapReduce">

	<p>Currently Eoulson can only work on cloud with Amazon Web Service. Eoulsan use 
           Amazon Elastic MapReduce service to execute an analysis on Cloud. This service 
           provide on demand Hadoop cluster to customers. You can get more information 
           about this service on <a href="ttp://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon 
           MapReduce website</a>.</p>

	<p>Once you get an Amazon Web Service Account and sign-in for Amazon 
           MapReduce and Amazon S3, go to Security credentials page of your AWS 
           Account. In this page create or get your access key. You need a couple 
           of valid access key/secret key to launch Eoulsan on Amazon Cloud.
           See the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/awsdocs/ElasticMapReduce/latest/emr-gsg.pdf">Amazon
           Elastic MapReduce Getting Started Guide</a> for more information.</p>

    <section name="Configure Eoulsan to work with Amazon Elastic MapReduce">

	<p>Eoulsan behaviour with Amazon Elastic MapReduce is the same as with 
           a Hadoop cluster. You don't have to change your design file or the 
           steps of the parameter file.</p>
        <p>The only must have to set the AWS 
           credentials in configuration file or parameter file. We strongly 
           recommand to store this values in a configuration file. See the 
           <a href="conffile.html">configuration file</a> section for more 
           information.</p>

    <section name="Launch Eoulsan in AWS mode">

	<p>The launch of an Eoulsan analysis on Amazon Cloud is described in 
           <a href="">AWS exec command section</a>.</p>
