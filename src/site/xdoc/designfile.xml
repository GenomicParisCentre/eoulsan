    <section name="Design file">

      <p>The design file is the main element of the pipeline. It contains all informations and descriptions of the experiment. It is a simple tabuled plain text file inspired by limma design file. Here a sample of design file:</p>
      
<source>
SampleNumber	Name	FileName	Genome	Annotation	GenomicType	Condition	ReplicateType
1	s1	s1.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	exon	s1	B
2	s2	s2.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	exon	s2	B
3	s3	s1.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	exon	s1	B
4	s4	s2.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	exon	s2	B
</source>

	<p>In a design file 3 fields are mandatory:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SampleNumber</b>: Numeric, must be unique and >0</li>
		<li><b>Name</b>: Name of the sample. Must be unique</li>
		<li><b>Filename</b>: Path to the reads data. Can be an URL</li>
	</ul>

	<p>User can add any additional field in this file. Some of the optional field are currently used in Eoulsan:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Genome</b>: Genome in fasta format</li>
		<li><b>Annotation</b>: Annotation of the genome in GFF3 format</li>
		<li><b>GenomicType</b>: Type of annoation to use in the expression module. <b>WARNING</b>: This field will not be used in the next version of the pipeline.</li>
		<li><b>Condition</b>: Condition for the sample in the experiement</li>
		<li><b>ReplicateType</b>: Type of replicate, two values are currently handled: "B" for biological replicate and "T" for technical replicate</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In next version of Eoulsan, compressed files in gzip (.gz) or bzip2 (.bz2) will be handled.</p>
